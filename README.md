Hi contributors,

I have set up the project on an expressjs backend. I did this just to have a templating engine available (currently using EJS). If you guys
want another backend solution (different language/framework), I am happy to refactor the code.

If you want to contribute to the project, you will need to install npm and node.
To run the project, just run `node server.js` from the command line, and you should be up and running.

## Running the App

To run the app you must have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
installed on your local machine or cloud instance.

**optional:**
*Install **Yarn** if you want to install packages much faster! (Thank you Facebook!).*

To run the app, type the following command in your shell/command line:
```
> git clone https://github.com/Startversity/Homepage

> cd HomePage

> npm install 
#or
> yarn install

> npm run dev
#or
> yarn dev
``` 

### Build the app.

To simply build your app in the `./dist` folder simply run `npm run build` or `yarn build`.

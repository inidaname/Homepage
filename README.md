Hi contributors,

I have set up the project on an expressjs backend. I did this just to have a templating engine available (currently using EJS). If you guys
want another backend solution (different language/framework), I am happy to refactor the code.

If you want to contribute to the project, you will need to install npm and node.
To run the project, just run `node server.js` from the command line, and you should be up and running.
